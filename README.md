# üß¨ Final Project - Statistical Theory

## üìù Abstract

Our research addresses the question: How do the characteristics of the cell nuclei of a breast mass affect its diagnosis (Malignant/Benign)?

In this project, we employed a range of statistical tools to analyze our dataset and draw conclusions. Additionally, we extended our research to another dataset, creating a function that predicts the diagnosis based on these characteristics.

## üìä Project Steps

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing

- **Dropping Unnecessary Columns:** We began by eliminating irrelevant columns to optimize our dataset.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Separation

- **2.1 Correlation and Clustering:**
  - **Correlation Map:** We examined the correlations between the 31 features and identified those with correlations above 0.8.
  - **Clustering:** Highly correlated features were grouped into clusters, with a representative feature chosen from each using the VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) method. The diagnosis feature was treated as its own cluster.
- **2.2 Hierarchical Clustering:**
  - **Spearman Correlation Matrix:** We applied Spearman correlation to cluster the features.
  - **Representative Selection:** We selected representatives from each cluster, retaining all features highly correlated with the diagnosis feature for further analysis.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Choosing a Method

- **Cross-Validation:** We performed cross-validation using an SVM with a linear kernel to evaluate model performance.
- **Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test:** The Shapiro-Wilk test was conducted on the cross-validation scores to check for normality.
- **Sign Test:** We used the sign test to determine the better feature selection method, opting to proceed with the first method based on the results.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Analysis

- **4.1 Normality Test:** Normality tests were conducted on the features to assess their distributions.
- **4.2 Hypothesis Testing:** For normally distributed features, hypothesis tests were conducted to assess their value in distinguishing between malignant and benign diagnoses.
- **4.3 Distribution Fitting for Non-Normal Features:**
  - We attempted to fit several distributions (`norm`, `expon`, `gamma`, `lognorm`, `beta`) to non-normal features using the Goodness-of-Fit method.
  - Fit assessments were conducted using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distributions and the Anderson-Darling test for others.
  - Only two features were successfully fitted with non-normal distributions.
- **4.4 Non-Parametric Tests:** We used the Mann-Whitney U test to evaluate the non-normal features‚Äô effectiveness in differentiating between malignant and benign diagnoses.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis

- **Histogram Plotting:** Histograms were plotted for the remaining data after feature reduction.
- **Pairwise Feature Analysis:** We analyzed all pairs of features in relation to cancer type, using the reduced correlation matrix and the Mann-Whitney U test to identify the most suitable pairs for cancer type separation.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation

- **SVC Linear Model:** We tested the accuracy of feature pairs using an SVM with a linear kernel. The model was trained to identify the most indicative features for cancer type, and we visualized the best separations.

#### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Combining Datasets

- **Socioeconomic Analysis:**
  - We explored the impact of socioeconomic status on breast cancer mortality by combining our main dataset (breast cancer in Wisconsin, 1992) with data from other states in 1992.
  - We added GDP data and population statistics to our dataset.
- **Proportion Calculation:** We calculated the proportion of breast cancer deaths relative to the total population for each state.
- **Chi-Square Test:**
  - We used the Chi-square test on population proportions categorized as ‚ÄòLow,‚Äô ‚ÄòMedium,‚Äô and ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô GDP.
  - The results indicated no significant relationship between a state‚Äôs GDP and the percentage of breast cancer deaths, suggesting that Wisconsin‚Äôs economic status in 1992 did not affect its breast cancer mortality rate.
